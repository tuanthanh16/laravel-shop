The specific climate in the southern part of Macedonia enables the production of delicious and fresh peppers and tomatoes. No other country in the world has so many homemade paprika recipes. Traditionally, from late summer to early autumn, the irresistible smell of roasted peppers spreads from every yard, reminding us that it's open season.
The fine texture and aromatic aromas are the result of a perfectly balanced ratio of peppers and eggplant, which gives a specific character to each MAMA'S jar.
